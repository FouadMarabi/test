# 2. Push to make the pull request and then merge it to develop branch on Azure repo
# 3. Pull down the develop branch and create release branch
# 4. Finish release branch and provide tag name in tag message and finish it
# 5. Now master gets the change, push master and checkout develop branch
# 6. Now we have two options but the latter is preferred one, merge master to develop then push it or merge tag into develop then push it
